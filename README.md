# Solution to UC Berkeley's 1st AI-project assignment.

## [Project 1: Search](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)

In this project, Pacman agent finds paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.<br>
We build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

To try this solution, you can replace the ***search.py*** and ***searchAgents.py*** files in the [**zip**](http://ai.berkeley.edu/projects/release/search/v1/001/search.zip) with the ones provided in this repo.<br>

#### Explanation about the algorithms implemented and how to test them can be found in the [report](project1_pacman_report.pdf).
